📝 Arabic Handwritten OCR using CNN

This project implements an Arabic Handwritten Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It is capable of recognizing and digitizing Arabic handwritten letters (alphabet) and digits (0–9) from scanned or photographed images.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Accurate recognition of Arabic handwritten characters and digits.

✅ Deep learning model built using TensorFlow/Keras.

✅ Custom preprocessing pipeline to handle Arabic script directionality, noise, and image normalization.

✅ Exposed as a RESTful API via Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive predictions.

✅ Fully Dockerized for easy deployment.

📊 Model Performance

Achieved [X]% accuracy on a custom-labeled dataset containing Arabic letters and digits.

Trained on data augmented with random rotations, shifts, and noise to improve real-world performance.
